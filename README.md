# Chris Meah Personal Website

## Project Overview

A future-proof, immersive 3D website built with **React Three Fiber (r3f)** for Chris Meah at [chrismeah.com](https://chrismeah.com). This project showcases Chris's expertise in **Building, Training, and Speaking** about AI through an innovative, interactive 3D experience. The futuristic aesthetic not only engages visitors but embodies the cutting-edge nature of Chris's work, encouraging connections for **consulting, speaking engagements, and training sessions**.

## Key Features

- Immersive **3D environment** powered by **r3f** and **Three.js**
- Interactive elements that **demonstrate AI concepts** in a visually compelling way
- **Minimalist yet technologically advanced** user interface
- Focused sections highlighting **Chris's expertise areas**
- Seamless **contact and booking functionality**
- **Responsive design** adaptable across all devices
- Testimonial showcase from past **clients and bootcampers**
- Video integration featuring **Chris's talks and appearances**

## Target Audience

- **Companies** seeking AI consulting services
- **Event organizers** looking for expert AI speakers
- **Individuals** wanting to learn about AI and Chris's background

## Technical Foundation

### **Current Tech Stack:**

- **Vite.js**
- **React Three Fiber (r3f)**
- **Trellis**
- **3js.editor**
- **ace-eternity**

### **Planned Enhancements:**

- **Integration with Blender** for custom 3D models
- More **advanced animations**
- A more **metallic, tech-like aesthetic**
- Built with **scalability** in mind for future **CMS integration**

## Concept & Inspiration

Our design approach was inspired by modern **3D websites** that effectively blend technology and aesthetics:

- We studied successful implementations like **Junni, Joshua's World, Ethereum Foundation, and Lusion**
- We chose **React Three Fiber (r3f)** as our foundation because it:
  - Aligns with the project requirement for a **React-based website**
  - Offers **powerful 3D capabilities** while maintaining React's **component-based approach**
  - Provides an **ideal platform** for creating a **futuristic, AI-focused aesthetic**
  - Allows for **easy maintenance and future expansion**

For the prototype, we used **Trellis** for rapid development, with plans to create more **custom 3D models** with input from Chris. The final product will feature **enhanced animations** and a **more sophisticated technological aesthetic**. Currently, the color is also mostly **blues**, but we plan to make it more **diverse**.
