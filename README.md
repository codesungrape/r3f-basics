# Chris Meah Personal Website - The AI Doctor

## Project Overview

A 3D website built with **React Three Fiber (r3f)** for **Chris Meah** at [chrismeah.com](http://chrismeah.com).

### **Current Tech Stack:**

- **Vite.js**
- **React Three Fiber (r3f)**
- **Trellis**
- **3js.editor**
- **ace-eternity**

## Inspiration

This project brings the idea of Chris as the 'AI Doctor' to lifeâ€”imagine Doctor Strange, but instead of bending reality, he's shaping the future of AI. We were actually debating if we should draw inspiration from a medical doctor or dr strange, we went with dr strange for this. 

## How it began

We stumbled upon the [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.foundation/) website and thought it was _super cool_. This led us down a rabbit hole of exploring other 3D websites, and after checking the source code in Chrome DevTools, we saw they were using **Three.js**.

Some of the coolest websites we came across:

1. ([Junni](https://next.junni.co.jp/))
2. [Joshuas World](https://www.joshuas.world/)
3. [Lusion](https://lusion.co/)

But the one that really stood outâ€”and became the main inspiration for our projectâ€”was[They Call Me Giulio](https://www.theycallmegiulio.com/).

After discovering Giulioâ€™s site, we had v0 try to recreate something similar because, at the time, we had no clue how to work with Three.js. The first attempt... well, it was _interesting_. ðŸ˜…

## Actual Implementation

Once we started experimenting with Three.js, we ended up creating some **3D Chris head cubes** ðŸ˜‚ (check out our [Figma Board](https://www.figma.com/board/mFvEvcsT1cp0253TmjVDhg/Untitled?node-id=7-154&t=PDPHYRzHhghXMML8-0)).

**Finding a Better Approach** â€“ As we got more comfortable with **React Three Fiber**, the idea of creating a Doctor Strange-inspired robot from scratch seemed a bit too much. So we thought, "Let's find a quicker way to make this happen."

To make the concept work, we realised it was nearly impossible to pull off just by tweaking the actual code (at least to a good standard). So, we decided to look into quicker and easier solutions to get a very basic first working version.

Being complete newbies to 3D modelling, hereâ€™s the plan we came up with:

1. **Use an existing robot design** â€“ We took inspiration from Giulioâ€™s robot, grabbed a screenshot (below), and asked **ChatGPT** to generate the rest of the body and add a Doctor Strange-style cape.

   **Result:** [![ai-doctor](/public/ai-doctor.png)]

2. **Convert 2D to 3D** â€“ Using **Trellis**, we turned the concept into a 3D model and extracted the `.glb` file.

   **Screenshot:**

3. **Refine the Model** â€“ Uploaded the `.glb` file to the **Three.js editor**, added lighting, made some tweaks, and exported the final `.gltf` file for our repo.

4. **Final Prototype** â€“ After uploading the model, playing around with it, and making sure it worked, we deployed the first working version!

## First Prototype Thoughts

The first working version is definitely not perfect. This is most likely as we were also pretty busy with Eid, Vonage Hackathon, preparing for interviews, 15 applications a week as per Vicky's advice and other things. That said, it's definetly not an excuse and we're excited about whatâ€™s next, having seem what we could achieve in the space of a few hours scattered over a week!

Hereâ€™s what we would like do in the future:

- **Blender Integration**: We want to improve the model by adding a more **metallic, tech-inspired aesthetic** for the custom 3D models.
- **Advanced Animations**: Using **Blender** and the **Animation Mixer**, we want to bring in more human-like movement for the 3D model.
- **Chris' journey**: The model should take the user on an interactive journey through Chris' achievements.
- **Customized 3D Avatar**:We love the Dr. AI and Dr. Strange inspirations! If you're open to it we would like to set up a **consultation with you** to discuss the best avatar to represent youâ€” we're just getting started with the 3D concept!
- **AI Chatbot Agent**: Weâ€™re adding a chatbot agent that can handle things like bookings.
- **Improved UI**: A more sophisticated and futuristic technological aesthetic for the site.
- **More Diverse Colours**: Right now, the colour scheme is mostly **blues**, but weâ€™re planning to introduce a wider range of colours.
- **Thoroughly tested**: Our solution will be rigorously evaluated across diverse scenarios to ensure reliability and performance in real-world applications.
